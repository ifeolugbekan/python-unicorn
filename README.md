- I am Ife Olugbekan
- An Exploratory Data Analytics for the Unicorn Companies using the python jupyter notebook.
- I uploaded the Dataset and did a thorough Data Cleaning and Manipulation.
- After which i generated effective insights and relationships using the Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis.
- I also made tremedious obervations at each of my generated insights.
- Finally, i gave an efficient and effective decision-making over recommendations, that if followed through, will definitely yield positive returns.
- The challenges i encountered were enormous, from data cleaning to insights generation.
- But i overcame these challenges due to constant hardwork and dedication.
